````markdown
# 🧠 K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to the popular **Mall Customers dataset** to identify unique customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. It's ideal for marketing teams, analysts, and data science learners looking to understand customer behavior.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Uses **scikit-learn's KMeans** to segment customers
- Applies **Elbow Method** to find optimal number of clusters
- Visualizes clusters using `matplotlib`
- Saves outputs as CSV and PNG images
- Provides **actionable insights** per cluster
- Fully compatible with **Python 3.13 and Windows 11**

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

- File: `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Columns:
  - `CustomerID`
  - `Gender`
  - `Age`
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`
